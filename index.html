            <h2>About</h2>
            <p>
              Hey everyone, I'm Tim - 29 - Dutch. I used to be a law student specialising
              in Law and Technology, but then it turned out that I find technology itself 
              a lot more fun and interesting than arguing about it as a lawyer...<br>
              So after I finished my master I decided I want to chase my dream 
              of becoming a programmer. Now I'm really excited to start making it happen at 
              Codaisseur and look forward to meeting you all on Monday!
              <br><br>
              P.S. I'm not so sure about the color scheme of the website so please keep clicking the Random
              button at the top until it looks good to you.

        <h2>Interests</h2>
        <div class="text">
          I tried to make some sketches to represent things I enjoy.
          I have a lot of different interests, but some of the main things I like to do when not working are:<br><br>
          <div class="bullet"></div>&nbsp;&nbsp;Going for walks through nature or cities. 
          It allows me to detox from the digital world. I can set my mind on other stuff or on nothing in particular 
          and just enjoy the surroundings. If I get stuck while practicing code it also helps me to order things
          in my head and find creative solutions more easily than when staring at a screen.<br><br>
          <div class="bullet"></div>&nbsp;&nbsp;I love music. I like discovering new artists and also play a little 
          guitar myself (I'm not very good yet, but enjoy it a lot. Even simple things can sound great sometimes!) 
          Some day I also want to learn to play the piano.<br><br>
          <div class="bullet"></div>&nbsp;&nbsp;And finally I just always like to learn and discover new things 
          through books, online articles, videos, podcasts or personal experience... I find almost anything can be fun
          and interesting when you delve into it. The last few months I've been learning Italian for at least
          a few minutes per day.

                I made a Tetris game a few months ago to practice after doing a codecademy.com course. The code is a mess
                but it was a lot of fun :) You can play it by clicking the image if you like.
